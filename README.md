# Shopr

Shopr is an Rails ecommerce engine which allows you to easily introduce a store into your Rails 5 applications.

## Features

* An attractive & easy to use admin interface with integrated authentication
* Full product/catalogue management
* Stock control
* Tax management
* Flexible & customisable order flow
* Delivery/shipping control, management & weight-based calculation

## Getting Started

Shopr provides the core framework for the store and you're responsible for creating
the storefront which your customers will use to purchase products. In addition to
creating the UI for the frontend, you are also responsible for integrating with whatever
payment gateway takes your fancy.

### Installing into a new Rails application

To get up and running with Shopr in a new Rails application is simple. Just follow the
instructions below and you'll be up and running in minutes.

```shell
rails new my_store
cd my_store
echo "gem 'shopr'" >> Gemfile
